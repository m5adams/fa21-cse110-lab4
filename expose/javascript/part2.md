# Part 2
<ol>
<li> This code prints the value of i which is 3 because it prints the variable within the for loop. In the for loop, i is incremented three times. </li>
<li> This returns 150. discountedPrice is a variable. It begins at 50 after the first iteration of the loop and ends at 150 after the third iteration. </li>
<li> This prints 150. finalPrice is a variable. It begins at 50 after the first iteration of the loop and ends at 150 after the third iteration. </li>
<li> This returns the array [50, 100, 150], the discounted price of each. </li>
<li> This results in an error. i is only in the for loop, cannot be accessed in this scope. </li>
<li> This results in an error. discountedPrice is not in the scope. </li>
<li> This returns 150. finalPrice can be used in the for loop. </li>
<li> This returns the aray [50, 100, 150]. discounted can be modified in the for loop. </li>
<li> This returns an error. i is no accessible in this part of the program. </li>
<li> This returns 3, the value of length. </li>
<li> This returns the array [50, 100, 150]. </li>
<li> a. student.name <br>
b. student["Grad Year"] <br> 
c. student.greeting() <br>
d. student["Favorite Teacher"].name <br>
e. student.courseLoad[0] </li>
<li> a. 32, concatenates the string 3 with 2 <br>
b. 1, 3 is a string. subtracting 2 from this makes 3 an integer. <br>
c. 3, null takes the numerical value 0. <br>
d. 3null, concatenates the string 3 with null. <br>
e. 4, true = 1 and 1 + 3 is 4 <br>
f. 0, false = null = 0, 0 + 0 = 0 <br>
g. 3undefined, concatenates the string 3 with undefined <br>
h. NaN, 3 is taken as an integer and undefined has no value </li>
<li> a. true, 2 is a string, 1 is an integer. 2 is converted to an integer for the comparison. <br>
b. false, comparing the strings 2 and 12 <br>
c. true, 2 is converted to an integer for the comparison <br>
d. false, there are two different types being compared with strict equality which checks the type <br>
e. false, true is equal to 1 which is not equal to 2 <br>
f. true, boolean assigned true because it has a nonzero value </li>
<li> == is a shallow equality, does not care about type. === is a deep equality, checking both value and type. </li>
<li> js file </li>
<li> This results in [2, 4, 6]. The function iterates through an array and multiplies each element by 2, returning the resulting array.  </li>
